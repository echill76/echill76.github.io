## Project description
This project was a group project which I worked on with 3 other people. I was responsible for the user interface for the game. However, I have included all the source files so that the game can be run properly.

## How to compile and run the program
Put the .java files into your favorite Java IDE and press run.

## UI Design
The user interface is designed to be as easy to understand as possible while still displaying all the necessary information and engaging the player in order to provide a satisfying chess experience.
