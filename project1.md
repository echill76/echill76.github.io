## Project description
This project takes a text file containing names of bowling players and their scores for a given bowling game and then performs a variety of operations on this input, which includes sorting the list from lowest score to highest score, taking the average of the scores, and displaying the name and score of the winning player. The output here is not to the console but rather to individual text files which show the results of the program.

## How to compile and run the program

(I forgot how to compile this program; need to fix this)

## UI Design
The output to the text files is designed to be easy to read while still providing all the necessary information.
